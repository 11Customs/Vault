>Config:
CPU: r9 7900 non x 
GPU: 7900xtx Sapphire Pulse
RAM: 32GB of FlareX5, 5600mhz cl30
MB: MSI b650i edge wifi
PSU: sf750
Case: Dan a4H20 (used to be Fractal Terra)
Cooling: EK Nucleus 240 (used to be NH-L12S)
Storage: 2x 250gb 970Evo + 2tb 870Evo

## Prelude
##### I used to run Terra with a couple of fans and NH-L12S, temps were fine tbh. But the sound, let's just say Terra larps as Boeing 747 with two slim Noctuas and NH-L12S. So a strategical decision was made to swap to an AIO, since Terra doesn't support anything other than a 120 AIO with a small GPU, swap the case too. So the final result:

##### Since AIO allows for more thermal headroom I decided to, let's say, optimize)

> #### !All tests were run in Armenian summer, so take the temps with a grain of salt!
> #### !I use Cinebench R23 as a reference, which is also questionable methodology!
