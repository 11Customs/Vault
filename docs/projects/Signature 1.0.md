Signature 1.0 is our first foray into the world of professional mousepads. The idea was to make a quality, jacquard pad, make it realatively affordable and create a lot of art variations. We ended up using our own manufacturing, after prototyping wiht X-Ray Pad. As a result we got a Mid/Speed pad, it depends on who you ask tbh.
