# Who are we 

_The contents of this Doc may change over time!_

## The intro
11customs is essentially a traveling merchant, started and founded by MLGFoxy and GAN!A. Due to the fact that we were born in CIS, 11customs moves from time to time. As of <code> 07-08-24 </code> 11customs is physically situated in *Yerevan, Armenia*; main inventory location in *Kyiv, Ukraine*. Unless this file is updated, we are still in AM. Don't worry we will let you know in advance when the physical location will be changing.

## What we do
We just sell shit we like for the most part, we also make our own shit sometimes. We try to keep most of the things on the shop open source where it is possible. You can check out our projects [here](./category/projects/). We also post in-depth blog posts about goings-on with the shop in the [Blog](/blog) section occasionally. Most of the products will be in the field of keyboards and HID devices eventually.

## The plan
We'll see to be honest. As I said before, 11customs is basically a traveling merchant of stuff we like. People may change, countries may change, inventory may change, even the design may change. But the idea will always be here. 

***Your purveyor of curiosities will always be here!***
