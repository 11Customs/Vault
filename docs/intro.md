# Who are we. 

_The contents of this Doc may change over time!_

## The intro.
11customs is essentially a traveling merchant, started and founded by MLGFoxy and GAN!A. Due to the fact that we were born in CIS, 11customs moves from time to time. As of <code> 07-08-24 </code> 11customs is physically situated in Yerevan, Armenia. Most of the time the physical inventory is situated wherever I (GAN!A) am. Since I am from russia and MLGFoxy is from Ukraine, the location of the shop is subject to change. Don't worry we will let you know in advance when the physical location will be mooving.

## What we do.
We just sell shit we like for the most part, we also do our own shit sometimes. We try to keep most of the things on the shop open source where it is possible. You can check out our projets [here](./docs/projects). We also post in-depth blog posts about goings on with the shop in the [Blog](./blog) section. Most of the products will be oriented around keyboards and HID devices eventually, for now we released the Mousepads since we promised some friends to do so. 

## Whats the story.
11Customs officially began it's existance sometime in 2020, back then it was a custom keyboard atelier. Unfortunately back then I lived in moscow, and let's just say the russian audience doesn't score high points in IQ and money departments. Fast forward to 2023 we decided to transform 11customs into somewhat of a "random shit" shop. And that where we are so far.
